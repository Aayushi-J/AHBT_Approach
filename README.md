# Advanced Hieroglyphic Braille Transpixelation (AHBT): A Novel Approach to Secure Image Steganography

This method enhances information security by integrating Braille and hieroglyphs into a sophisticated algorithm for digital image hiding. This technique utilizes multilevel encryption and LSB steganography to improve data security and visual quality, achieving superior PSNR rates compared to traditional methods. 
Modern correspondence protection is highly in demand for the protection of information exchange, mainly by means of cryptography and steganography. In this paper, a new method called Advanced Hieroglyphic Braille Transpixelation, or AHBT, is proposed and introduced. AHBT amalgamates Braille and hieroglyphs into a very complex algorithm of information hiding in digital images. The plaintext message will first be translated into hieroglyphics and Braille, then encrypted into 8-bit and 6-bit binary formats, correspondingly. These are camouflaged with columnar transposition and hidden inside the 2 LSB of pixel components (r, g, b) using LSB steganography, storing 6 bits of data per pixel. Experimental results have proven AHBT to improve in data security and visual quality compared to conventional methods, evidenced through higher PSNR rates. This technique is a revolution in personal information protection, as it has used multilevel encryption, steganography, and ancient scripts in combination for better security and privacy.
